There are four demos in the BayesPI toolbox (run_demos1, run_demos2, run_demos3 and run_demos4).
Some results of Figure 1 were based on those four demos. At present, the toolbox only works for data with small sample size. In the future, a more complete BayesPI toolbox with advanced functions will be provided.
